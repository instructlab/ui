          Knowledge contributions enable you to add new facts, data, or references into your model to enhance its ability to accurately answer
          questions. Upload a document such as a textbook, technical manual, or journal, to get started.

          The Q and A pairs that you create should be diverse. Rephrase questions in different ways, and create unique contexts.
        </Content>
        For example, when training a model to answer questions about a context that contains information about different species of birds and their
        visual characteristics, donâ€™t create Q and A pairs that only relate to finches. Doing so might unintentionally prevent the model from
        answering questions about other bird species.
