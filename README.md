Project aims to provide a UI based interface to the contributors and reviewers to submit and review contribution to [instructlab/taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy).
The intention is to simplify the process of contribution by providing a user friendly interface, that doesn't require the user to have a deep understanding of tools required to contribute skill and knowledge to the taxonomy. This project also aims to provide a platform for the reviewers to efficiently review the contributions and provide feedback to the contributors.

## Overview

Current scope of the project is to work on following personas:

- Taxonomy **Contributor**: Person who wants to contribute a skill or a knowledge to the taxonomy.
- Taxonomy **Triager**: Person who has expertise to review the contributions and provide feedback to the contributors.

The technical overview and developer docs for getting started can be found [here](docs/development.md).
