# InstructLab UI

Welcome to the repo for the InstructLab UI! This UI was created as
a front end in order to streamline the contribution and triaging process 
for users of the [instructlab/taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy).

## Overview

We currently have features implemented to streamline contributor workflow.
Please check out our UI [here](http://34.229.17.203:4000/).

#### Current Features:

- Chat with full precision Granite-7B and Merlinite-7B models
- Automatically generate properly formatted qna.yaml documents for both
  knowledge and skill submissions
- Automatically generate attribution.txt files
- Submit to create pull request on personal branch

#### Proposed Features

- Document conversion to markdown for knowledge submissions
- Integrate triager tooling to streamline triage process

#### Personas:
