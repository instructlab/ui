Project aims to provide a UI based interface to the contributors and reviewers to submit and review contribution to [instructlab/taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy).
The intention is to simplify the process of contribution by providing a user friendly interface, that doesn't require the user to have a deep understanding of tools required to contribute skill and knowledge to the taxonomy. This project also aims to provide a platform for the reviewers to efficiently review the contributions and provide feedback to the contributors.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> InstructLab Community UI instance is currently hosted [here](https://ui.instructlab.ai). Please feel free to user the UI for contributing skills and knowledge to the taxonomy. If you have any feedback or suggestions please feel free to open an issue. See more details in the [Contributing](#contributing) section.

## Overview

Current scope of the project is to work on following personas:

- Taxonomy **Contributor**: Person who wants to contribute a skill or a knowledge to the taxonomy.
- Taxonomy **Triager**: Person who has expertise to review the contributions and provide feedback to the contributors.

The technical overview and developer docs for getting started can be found [here](docs/development.md).

The UI can be installed and run locally by following the instruction [here](installers/podman/README.md).
